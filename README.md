## 🏛️ **Project Architecture: The Big Picture**

Think of this application like a **Nigerian Government Building**:

```
🏛️ Vote-E-9ja Government Building
├── 🚪 Front Entrance (App.jsx) - Where everyone enters
├── 🛡️ Security Checkpoint (AuthContext.jsx) - Verify who you are
├── 📋 Registration Office (Register.jsx) - Sign up new voters
├── 🗳️ Voting Booth (Login.jsx) - Cast your vote
├── 🏦 Records Department (supabase/) - Store all data securely
├── 📏 Rules & Regulations (validation.js) - Ensure everything is valid
└── 🎨 Interior Design (CSS files) - Make it look professional
```

### **Data Flow: How Information Moves**
```
User Input → Validation → Authentication → Database → UI Update
     ↑                                                      ↓
     └──────────── User Feedback ←──────────────────────────┘
```

## 🔐 **Security: Why It Matters**

In a voting system, security isn't optional - it's **essential**. We implement:

- **🔒 Authentication**: Verify users are who they claim to be
- **🛡️ Authorization**: Control what users can access
- **🔐 Data Encryption**: Protect sensitive information
- **📝 Audit Trails**: Track all actions for transparency
- **✅ Input Validation**: Prevent malicious data entry

## 🇳🇬 **Nigerian Context: Why This Matters**

This isn't just any voting app - it's designed for **Nigerian elections**:

- **📱 Phone Number Validation**: Nigerian mobile formats (080, 081, 070, etc.)
- **🆔 NIN Integration**: National Identification Number support
- **🗓️ Age Verification**: 18+ voting requirement
- **🏛️ Electoral Compliance**: Following INEC guidelines
- **🌍 Local Languages**: Prepared for multi-language support
